# Front team's documentation

March 7th :
We spent some time on configuring the React App.
Note for the team that will take over the Front side next week :
1- Clone the repository
2- Open your terminal, go on the folder, and type "npm install" before doing anything else. It will install the node-modules locally and will allow you to launch the app.
3- Type "npm start" to launch the app and open a webpage to check that everything's good.

Tip of the day: install the VSCode extension "Simple React Snippet"

March 8th :
We dispatched the work between the navbar, the main product space, and the footer.
We mostly spent some time building the different components, and trying to style everything a bit.
Some recommendation for the next days: we might consider moving every component in its own folder, for instace: have a Navbar folder containing the Navbar component + the Navbar CSS file.

March 10th :
We struggled a lot with Git, so it was not a super productive day.

However, we managed to set up the routing to be able to navigate from a page to another. You need to update the index.js with the appropriate pages and links, in the render.
The App.js is the equivalent of the Home page of the Website.
You don't need to call Navigation and Footer outside of index.js, otherwise it will be rendered 2 times on the screen.

Currently we have an issue with rendering the carousel + the product grid ; it might be a CSS problem to fix.
We are waiting for the database to implement the correct product data and stop hard-coding the data.

Also, the header is a bit broken (doesn't fit on the screen anymore).


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
